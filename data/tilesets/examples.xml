			<!-- these coordinates does not need to be completely accurate, 
			as long as they are relative to the image; but they need to be close to, 
			and preferably cover, the walkable area of the surface.
			
			the way I want this to work is, if the player collides with an object 
			on the pixel level, the object should know which friction to use, 
			so the object chooses the vector closest to the player and uses that 
			to calculate how much the player would slip downwards from say.. a slope
 
			I chose to put friction with each vector, this way an entity can have 
			different friction forces for different areas of the object
			since this entity will be able to rotate and move, all of the sides 
			will be included -->
