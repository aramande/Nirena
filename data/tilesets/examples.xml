			<!-- these coordinates does not need to be completely accurate,

			the way I want this to work is, if the player collides with an object 
			on the pixel level, the object should know which friction to use, 
			so the object chooses the vector closest to the player and uses that 
			to calculate how much the player would slip downwards from say.. a slope
 
			I chose to put friction with each vector, this way an entity can have 
			different friction forces for different areas of the object-->
